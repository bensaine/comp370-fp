# What did we do:
- adjusted 'ben_data_collection.ipynb' to gather more news sources.
In particular, we sampled articles from the NewsAPI.org "/v2/everything" endpoint,
which includes articles from over 150,000 large and small news sources and blogs.

They are all mainstream outlets,
and given the large viewership on Trump's recent podcast interviews,
